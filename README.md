#  My Portfolio

# Description
We were asked to create a responsive portfolio website that included a functional NavBar, responsive images and layout. The main code for this project is bootstrap
## Issues
The primary issue for this project was making the website look good with all devices and making sure to use bootstrap in an efficient and correct way.
## Website Features
Working links to a Home/About Me page, a Contact Me page and a Portfolio Page. Responsive images and layout with custom icons that link to my socials and a sticky navbar (instead of a sticky footer).
## CSS Changes Made
I used CSS for changing text and background colors. The selection within bootstrap is poor. I do not know of any other ways to access a bigger color library within bootstrap.
## Collaborators
With instruction from Fil and Daniel.
